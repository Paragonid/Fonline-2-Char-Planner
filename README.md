Fonline 2 Char Planner

This is a tool to calculate character characteristics in Fonline 2 on certain level.
It works as a static browser page.

Planner is outdated on september 2015.

Using:

1. Download

2. Open index.html in your browser

Development:

Project was made up to current state without version control.

fcp.js is the only script included in the page.

Folder is dirty and has some other useless stuff.
Code is generally badly structured. Sorry.

Development by me is closed. Fork it and do whatever you want.

I made some improvements over this project, changing the logic in the same time in repository Fonline-AoP-Char-Planner. You can try to take something from there.
